    Add the contents of the ajax_func.php file to the functions.php file in your site template.
    Place the contents of the Behive.js file in a <script></script> tag and add it to your site's footer or desired page.

Note:

    On line 19, replace "Form Class" with the name of your desired form class, which represents your HTML form.
    On lines 84 and 29, replace "input class" with the actual class name of the input fields in your HTML form.
    On line 92, specify the class name for the message that will be displayed when the subscription is successful.

These customizations ensure that the code is tailored to your specific form and input fields and will function correctly on your website.
